Hello, Cherry Hencefox, it's Ralzi here.

I've been thinking about how I'm going to write message for quite a while now, and I've failed several times to write it in the past because I could not find the right words to say, but now I have the correct words in mind, but before I start, I need to provide a bit of backstory as to why I'm writing this today:

As you have probably seen in the #ðŸ“·pics-vids channel on your Discord server, I've been posting mainly bus photos, while making sure to attach the type/make/model, fleet ID and a short caption. This has been something that I have done in many other servers on Discord, and even outside on other social media, and almost every time that I posted one, I would have been judged heavily for it.

As well as this, back in May-July 2024 when I was feeling down because of bullies in school (because quite frankly my school didn't care what I was going through), your music is what accompanied me, like it was a friend that I could call on-demand at any time I needed to, as I didn't have many friends back in 2024.

So, now that I have that out of the way, why am I actually writing this? Well, it's obvious, it's to thank you for not only getting me through those times, not only for not judging me, but for showing me that there are still good people in this world. After I started feeling down, I thought I had seen it all, but now I know that it's people like you that I should look up to in the future. All of the people that I have talked with in your Discord server have been amazing, and I'm honoured to be in it with all of these amazing people.

### Thank you, Cherry Hencefox.
