# ralzitech.github.io

This is where my website is hosted, which is essentially a wrapper for my Wix site, just without the banner at the top. It's one of the many sites using [mine and Jibbosh's WixView Project](https://ralzi.jibbosh.com/wixview)

## Directories

- /assests: This is where site assets may be stored
- /static: This is where small file downloads are uploaded to
- /redir: This is where I will put redirects to other sites in so that I don't need to type out the whole URL
