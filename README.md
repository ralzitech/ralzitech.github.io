# ralzitech.github.io (aka RalziTech.com)

This is where my website is hosted, which is essentially a wrapper for my Wix site, just without the banner at the top. It's one of the many sites using [mine and Jibbosh's WixView Project](https://ralzitech.com/wixview)

## Known issues

- Both ralzitech.github.io and RalziTech.com are known to be blocked on school networks, including on London Grid for Learning. This is a problem out of our control that will require someone at LGfL to manually approve the site. If you want my website unblocked in your school, **I cannot help you in that scenario** - you will need to contact your nominated contact/IT admin to get it unblocked.

## Directories

- /assests: This is where site assets will be stored excluding the stylesheet
- /static: This is where small file downloads are uploaded to. Unlike /img, this is supposed to be dedicated to the site only, and not to uploads that are meant to be shared elsewhere
- /redir: This is where I will put redirects to other sites in so that I don't need to type out the whole URL
- /img: This is an image directory that I will use to share images in servers that I don't have permission to share in
- /ai: This is where I'll put all of the website that I get WebsimAI to generate. This directory within itself is set to have an index file when I'm eveuntually done with it
