# ralzitech.github.io (aka RalziTech.com)

This is where my website is hosted, which is essentially a wrapper for my Wix site, just without the banner at the top. It's one of the many sites using [mine and Jibbosh's WixView Project](https://ralzitech.com/wixview)

## Known issues

- Both ralzitech.github.io and RalziTech.com are known to be blocked on school networks, including on London Grid for Learning. This is a problem out of our control that will require someone at LGfL to manually approve the site. If you want my website unblocked in your school, **I cannot help you in that scenario** - you will need to contact your nominated contact/IT admin to get it unblocked.

- Sometimes when clicking on the "Start RalziTech WixView" button in the header, you may get stuck on a blue screen. The fix to this is usually reloading the page (CTRL + R) or clearing your cookies (you can do this from your browser's settings). Usually reloading works first time, so try that first before anything else.

- The Busmiles embed on the main index page can be a little oversized depending on what device you are using. I am working on a fix to this and will be implementing it as soon as I can

## Directories explained

- /assests: This is where site assets will be stored excluding the stylesheet
- /static: This is where small file downloads are uploaded to. Unlike /img, this is supposed to be dedicated to the site only, and not to uploads that are meant to be shared elsewhere
- /redir: This is where I will put redirects to other sites in so that I don't need to type out the whole URL
- /img: This is an image directory that I will use to share images in Discord/Revolt servers that I don't have permission to share in
- /ai: This is where I'll put all of the website that I get WebsimAI to generate. This directory within itself is set to have an index file when I'm eveuntually done with it

## Files explained
*Mobile.html, index.html, 404/403.html and offline.html are all very much self explanatory*

- cherryhencefox.md: The only markdown page on this site besides this Readme here - it's a thank you message that I wrote to Cherry Hencefox for getting me through some difficult times (and more)
- CNAME: The record that allows my website to communicate with my custom domain, RalziTech.com
- Wix.html: The new page for where WixView will be kept
- myinstant.html: This is where I will put all of the sounds I have uploaded to myinstants.com
