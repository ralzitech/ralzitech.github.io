# ralzitech.github.io

This is where my website is hosted, which is essentially a wrapper for my Wix site, just without the banner at the top. It's one of the many sites using [mine and Jibbosh's WixView Project](https://ralzi.jibbosh.com/wixview)

## Directories

- /assests: This is where site assets may be stored
- /static: This is where small file downloads are uploaded to. Unlike /img, this is supposed to be dedicated to the site only, and not to uploads that are meant to be shared elsewhere
- /redir: This is where I will put redirects to other sites in so that I don't need to type out the whole URL
- /img: This is an image directory that I will use to share images in servers that I don't have permission to share in
- /ai: This is where I'll put all of the website that I get WebsimAI to generate. This directory within itself is set to have an index file
